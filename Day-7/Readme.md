**Hangman Game**
A fun and challenging game to test your vocabulary!

**How to Play**:
- The computer randomly selects a word from a list of words.
- You have 6 lives to guess the word.
- Each time you guess a letter that is in the word, the letter will be revealed.
- If you guess a letter that is not in the word, you will lose a life.
- If you lose all your lives, you lose the game.💀
- If you guess the word correctly, you win the game!🏆
**How to Run the Game**
  1. Clone this repository to your computer.
  2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the repository directory.
**Run the following command:**
  '''python hangman.py'''

**Tips**💡
- Try to guess the vowels first, as they are more common in English words.
- If you are stuck, you can try guessing the word's length.
- If you are really stuck, you can always give up and start a new game.
**Enjoy**!
